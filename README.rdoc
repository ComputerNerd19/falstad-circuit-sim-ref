= jCircSim

This program is a electronic circuit simulator originally written by Paul Falstad
from www.falstad.com . This version introduces file import/export and a stand-alone Java-GUI.

You can download a pre-compiled jar from the REPO. This jar is not always updated so for most uptodate
version compile it for yourself.
